A library of JavaScript utilities that may be useful in banking.

For the moment this is more of an experiment for me in evaluating the capabilities of JavaScript unit test and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) frameworks, and seeing how well I can integrate them into my builds.

Currently testing with...

Jasmine BDD for JavaScript: https://jasmine.github.io/
    This is a reasonably lightweight behaviour-driven development framework produced by the nice folks at Pivotal Labs. The syntax is quite similar to that of RSpec.
    To run the Jasmine tests, open the following page in your browser:
        src/test/javascript/jasmine-standalone-1.0.2/SpecRunner.html

Please get in touch if you know of an alternative test framework that I could try out.


If you are familiar with Maven, you will recognise the project structure:

    src/
        pom.xml
        main/ ----> The directory under which 'release' code should go.
            webapp/
                index.jsp ----> Default home page for the test web app.
                js/
                    ebnkr-js/
                        ebnkr.js
                WEB-INF/
                    web.xml
        test/ ----> The directory where all test (i.e. unit tests) code should go.
            javascript/
                jasmine-standalone-1.0.2/ ----> The Jasmine BDD test framework for JavaScript.
                    lib/
                        jasmine-1.0.2
                    spec/ ----> Jasmine test specifications go in here.
                        ebnkr.Spec.js
                    SpecRunner.html ----> Launch this in your browser to run Jasmine tests.

To take full advantage going forward, you should install Maven (http://maven.apache.org/).
With Maven installed, you can open a shell on the ebnkr-js (the one with pom.xml in it) directory and run:
    mvn jetty:run
That will run up a Jetty web server running the test web application. The test application is somewhat limited at the moment, but I intend to use this to enable build-time testing using Selenium or some other such regression testing tool.
